This is a Python package to interface with an Insteon Modem. It has been
tested to work with most USB or RS-232 serial based devices such as the
`2413U <https://www.insteon.com/powerlinc-modem-usb>`__,
`2412S <https://www.insteon.com/powerlinc-modem-serial>`__,
`2448A7 <http://www.insteon.com/usb-wireless-adapter>`__ and Hub models
`2242 <https://www.insteon.com/support-knowledgebase/2014/9/26/insteon-hub-owners-manual>`__
and `2245 <https://www.insteon.com/insteon-hub/>`__. Other models have
not been tested but the underlying protocol has not changed much over
time so it would not be surprising if it worked with a number of other
models. If you find success with something, please let us know.

This **pyinsteon** package was created primarily to support an INSTEON
platform for the `Home Assistant <https://home-assistant.io/>`__
automation platform but it is structured to be general-purpose and
should be usable for other applications as well.

------------

-  Python 3.9, 3.10 or 3.11, 3.12
-  Posix or Windows based system
-  Some form of Insteon PLM or Hub
